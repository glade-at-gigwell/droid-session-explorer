User comment: you should use droid-control for TUI verification when appropriate!

## 2026-06-16T19:54:54-07:00 — Segment view always includes hidden buckets
**Type**: decision
**Context**: The spec called for default stats to exclude subagent/exec sessions, but also wanted a segment view to explain what the default scope excludes. If `bySegment` inherited the default filters, it would only show `main`.
**Resolution**: `bySegment` forces `includeSubagents` and `includeExec` while still honoring project/model/date filters. The alternative was requiring `stats --by segment --all`, but that makes the explanatory view easy to misread.

## 2026-06-16T19:56:27-07:00 — Split interpreting docs by concern
**Type**: decision
**Context**: The implementation added stats cross-tab semantics to `interpreting.md`, making that reference a mix of cost caveats, analytics math, and insights rules.
**Resolution**: Kept `interpreting.md` as a small router and moved details into `usage-semantics.md`, `stats-analytics.md`, and `insights.md`. The alternative was appending more sections to one file, but that would make future skill loading less precise.

## 2026-06-16T19:57:13-07:00 — Absorb the empty interpreting router
**Type**: deviation
**Context**: After splitting details into atomic references, `interpreting.md` only routed readers to files already listed in the parent skill. Keeping it would add an extra hop with no content.
**Resolution**: Removed `interpreting.md`, listed focused references directly in `SKILL.md`, and embedded the focused files in the dsx sub-droid cheatsheet. The alternative was keeping a near-empty router for compatibility, but the user explicitly did not want legacy compatibility here.

## 2026-06-16T19:59:07-07:00 — Source TUI launch command needs preload before file
**Type**: surprise
**Context**: The first droid-control TUI verification used `bun --preload ... run src/index.ts`, which Bun treated as invalid `bun run` usage rather than launching the TUI.
**Resolution**: Discarded that capture as non-evidence and reran verification with `bun --preload @opentui/solid/preload src/index.ts --no-refresh tui`. The alternative was using the failed artifact anyway, but it only proved command misuse.

## 2026-06-16T20:01:54-07:00 — Daily usage rows carry pro-rated tool metrics
**Type**: tradeoff
**Context**: TUI metric cycling and CLI `--metric` include tool/error metrics, but the first daily group query only returned token and credit fields. That made some metric selections render as zeroes.
**Resolution**: Added pro-rated `activeTimeMs`, `toolCalls`, and `toolErrors` to daily and grouped usage rows, using the same assistant-message weighting as tokens/credits. The alternative was rejecting unsupported metrics per view, but that would make the TUI metric cycle inconsistent and less useful.

## 2026-06-16T20:03:44-07:00 — Split analytics assertions into atomic tests
**Type**: decision
**Context**: The initial query coverage put day-group, tool-matrix, segment, and distribution assertions in one broad test. The over-coverage pass found that each invariant had the same owning integration suite but separate failure modes.
**Resolution**: Split the assertions into focused tests inside `tests/indexer.test.ts`. The alternative was keeping one broad smoke test, but that made regressions less local and violated the requested atomicity.

## 2026-06-16T20:18:07-07:00 — Stats TUI top bar needs text state, not just color
**Type**: bugfix
**Context**: tctl snapshots strip styling, and the dimension row only changed background color for the selected tab. That made automated verification weak and made the top bar look static if color rendering lagged or was unavailable. Long project inputs also displayed through the input viewport, so the visible value could be misleading while editing closed.
**Resolution**: Render the selected dimension with explicit brackets and show project/model filter values as text chips when not editing, using inputs only while editing. This makes `tab`, `w`, `v`, `a`, `p`, and `m` state transitions visible in both terminal snapshots and normal TUI use.
